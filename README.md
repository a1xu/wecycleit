# WeCycleIt

WeCycleIt is a web application that allows users to easily recycle specific items by helping
find recycling centers that accept said item near a given zip code.

This app also helps with identifying which items are actually recyclable.

This web app is targeted towards homeowners looking to get rid of their junk when moving in/out 
of their homes, but it can be used by anyone that's looking to recycle an item.
