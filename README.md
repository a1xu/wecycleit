# WeCycleIt

WeCycleIt is a web application that allows users to easily recycle items by helping
find recycling centers near a given zip code.
This app also helps identify which items are actually recyclable.

This web app is targeted towards homeowners looking to get rid of their junk when moving in/out 
of their homes, but it can be used by anyone that's looking to recycle an item.
