Milestone 3

## UI Improvements

Based on feedback, we have added the name of our app at the top of every page as well as more descriptive titles and page headers so that users looking at the app for the first time will have some sort of idea of what the app does.

On the homepage, we have added a short welcome blurb that concisely summarizes the purpose of the app. The map screen now has a more descriptive header that tells users what the page is for.
