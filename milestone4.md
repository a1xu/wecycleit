## UI Improvements
Based on the feedback from the previous grading, we have decided to switch from the main view of a search result map to a search result list instead. The idea behind this would be to differentiate ourselves more from google maps by instead providing a list with center information and then giving the users the ability to switch to a map view if desired (to be implemented later).

In addition to the feedback we received, we have also integrated the Earth911 API in order to use the search results from that and store them within the database. We have also changed the UI between the main page and the search page by having the search page automatically take the zip code that was given and displaying it rather than prompting the user to input the zipcode twice.

## User Action 1
### Search for a Recycling/Donation Center
Users can select between searching for a recycling center or a donation center by interacting with the drop down box. This works in conjunction with entering a zip code. These combined interactions make it possible for them to search for a center in their preferred zip code.

## User Action 2
### Filtering the Search
This allows the users to find a center based on the filters they have chosen. This is considered one of the main functionalities because it makes it easier for the users to find their desired center. For instance, if they wanted a water botle specific center, then they would be able to choose this filter and have the subsequent results appear. 

## User Action 3
### Scheduling an Appointment with the Center
After finding a desired center, users can click on the center to get more information. Depending on the center, they will be able to schedule an appointment with them. This has fields for the user to input their information and send it to the center's email so that the center may respond to their inquiries.
