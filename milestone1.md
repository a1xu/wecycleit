## Project Proposal
1. Project Idea: A mobile web application that will display information relevant to recycling and donating. 
2. Target population and why none of us belong to it: The target population is homeowners since they are more likely to have a substantial income that would allow them to have multiple products. They may also have a disposable income that can go towards buying replacement items. As such, none of us belong to this target population because we do not have the income necessary to be able to buy multiple products nor do we have the income to own homes. Since homeowners can actually buy and own things, they are more likely to buy replacements for those things or have a need for offloading them in some way. This is especially true for those who are more charitable or environmentally-conscious. 
3. Possible APIs/datasets:
* APIs:
    * [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en)
    * [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/?hl=en) or [CityGrid](http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Places+API) or [Foursquare Venue](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/venues) or [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/)
* Datasets:
    *  [Earth911](https://search.earth911.com/)?
    *  [Recycling Today](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/page/webexclusives/)
